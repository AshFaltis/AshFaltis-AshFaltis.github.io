I only started learning to draw backgrounds recently, a couple of months ago in May 2020. I started my studies off with 2 referenced drawings and then went on to draw a couple unreferenced. I have also experimented a bit with painting, I post them on my Instagram which you can find in the media section of this website.

		<p>Title: Untitled</p>
		<p>Time until completion: 2hr 52min (it felt like a lot longer)</p>
		<p>Info: This is my first studied piece that I used reference for, it was super fun to make and quite relaxing surprisingly. If you are thinking about drawing landscapes then I would highly recommend you give it a go.  </p> </article>

		<p>Title: Koi Pond</p>
		<p>Time until completion: 2hr 54min</p>
		<p>Info: I got inspiration for this drawing when my friends started drawing their own little versions of Koi fish. I thought the idea of a Koi fish pond would be cute. Obviously, I also added a horse, fun fact about me is I love horses and I actually own a few on my farm. They are also super fun to draw!   </p> </article>

		<p>Title: Fairy Garden</p>
		<p>Time until completion: 5hr 11min</p>
		<p>Info: This was my first unreferenced drawing. I changed my ideas a couple of times with this. For example: I got rid of a little rock hill that was meant to be on the other side of the pond. This landscape was also inspired by my backyard, which from a young age I thought had always looked magical. When I was young my mum and old neighbours use to tell me and my little sister stories about fairies living in our paddocks. So, I thought I would bring that to life.   </p> </article>
