	<h2>Here I have my favourite portraits I’ve completed so far. Each one will have taken roughly 4 hours to finish and are my own personal characters. Some of you may recognise the last image as an old TikTok trend and so yes, I did take part in that. I do take a lot of inspiration from trends, games or stories.</h2> </article>

		<p>Time until completion: 7hr and 23min (I know right wow)</p>
		<p>Info: So, this is the drawing I did based on an old TikTok trend. People would put makeup on to a song making them look like the two characters split onto one face. This was one of the most fun drawing to create by far, defiantly worth the 7 hours it took. </p> </article>

		<p>Time until completion: 4hr and 11min</p>
		<p>Info: I made this drawing a little while back, during a time I felt a little bit down. I wanted to express my emotions; hence this piece was created. I was feeling a little like a fallen angel I suppose, I was trying to help people but I kept getting shut down.  </p> </article>

		<p>Title: Dark Core</p>
		<p>Time until completion: 2hr ad 46min</p>
		<p>Info: This is one of my more recent ones, done in 2020. This piece was inspired by an evil company in a game I like and have been playing for 7 years, star stable. They are an oil company and have a mysterious magical person working for them, no one knows what they look like. So, I went ahead and drew what I thought they would look like. Very fun!  </p> </article>

		<p>Title: Ghoul Girl</p>
		<p>Time until completion: 4hr and 36min</p>
		<p>Info: So back in the day and sort of still now, I was very interested in creepy stories and creepypastas, so I made my own. I had an older drawing of her from a couple of years ago and I remade it late 2019. It’s about a girl who hated the world and wanted to destroy it. So, she finds a secret military base and manages to release hundreds of atomic bombs. But while hiding out, the radiation had gotten to her and she began to decompose. Eventually she had to rely on radiation to survive. Hence the small bomb attached to her back  </p> </article>

		<p>Title: Untitled</p>
		<p>Time until completion: 4hr and 4min</p>
		<p>Info: I did this piece as part of a school project in 2019. My theme was basically the concept of getting knocked down but getting back up again, to never give up! In this piece I drew the storm washing the flowers away, but as they are disappearing new ones are already growing back.  </p> </article>
